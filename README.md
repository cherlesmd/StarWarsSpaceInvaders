# StarWarsSpaceInvaders
A small game project to help myself apply newly learned python knowledge and learn more library functionalities. Not a full featured game clone, missing a starting screen and replay option. Just a constant loop of gameplay to see what I can do with it.
Written in python v3.7.
Built with the pygame library.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites
Written in python 3.7 so this would be the recommended version to have installed.
Runs on pygame wich can be installed with one quick command
``` sh
    pip install pygame
```

### Installation
Clone the repo
``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/cherlesmd/StarWarsSpaceInvaders.git
```
Thats it, not much to it really

### Usage
When in the same directory as the .py file you can start the game with the follwoing command
``` sh
    python3 SpaceInvadersGame.py
```
